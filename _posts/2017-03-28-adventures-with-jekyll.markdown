TLDR; Jekyll and Bootstrap have made web presence/maintenance nearly painless.

After spending several years borrowing HTML/CSS templates and making brute-forcing website updates, I decided to leap forward a decade or two. Hate it or love it, automation in small, targeted doses is probably useful.

I'd like to eventually start a photo blog (a la [shoottokyo.com](https://shoottokyo.com){:target="_blank"}), but my sparse and irregular shooting schedule is not well-suited for regular photo blogging. But one can dream.
