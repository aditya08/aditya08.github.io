*I am currently on leave from Wake Forest University.*

I am always looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students who want to pursue research in high performance computing, machine learning, numerical linear algebra, and numerical optimization. If you are interested in getting involved, then please email me. Our work requires a solid foundation in linear algebra and experience coding in C/C++. A formal background (e.g. through coursework) is helpful, but not required.
