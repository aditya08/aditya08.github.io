*I am actively looking for motivated students to join the REASOn Lab.
If you are passionate about high performance computing, parallel algorithms, optimization, or related topics, then please contact me.*

*We typically program in MATLAB, Python, and/or C/C++ depending on the research problem.
We often use OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, or other high-level abstractions to write parallel code.*
